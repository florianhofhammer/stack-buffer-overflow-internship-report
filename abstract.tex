    The goal of the presented paper is to summarize different stack buffer overflow attack and defense methods in a single paper.
    During this process, the question arises how some defense methods can be bypassed by an attacker and how a defender can improve on the defense mechanisms to thwart stack buffer overflow based attacks.

    To achieve these goals and answer these questions, several attack methods and their implications on the security of currently deployed defense mechanisms are presented.
    They show that even on modern systems, stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code controlled by an attacker under specific circumstances.
    Although stack buffer overflows are hard or impossible to exploit depending on the circumstances of the vulnerability and the system configuration, the need for security measure enhancements arises.
    Such improvements and expansions on current defense mechanisms against stack buffer overflows are also presented and compared with regard to their performance implications on a system.

    As a result, it can be seen that stack buffer overflow exploits have gotten harder over the last years but that there are still possibilities to exploit such vulnerabilities.
    This paper shows that there are several possibilities to counter said attacks and that there is thus still a lot of space for improvement.
